# Kung Fu Coders - Virtual Try-on

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project proposes a novel solution using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate unique clothing items based on user-specified text prompts. The goal is to empower users to:

- Express their personal style
- Visualize clothing in real-time

By bridging the gap between imagination and reality, this project aims to democratize fashion design and create a more personalized shopping experience for users.

## Team Details

- **Team Name:** Kung Fu Coders
- **Members:**
  - Cynthia (21BCE5068)
  - Sweety Singh (21BPS1050)
  - Anushka Tonk (21BAI1761)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
# Front-End and Back-End Solution

## Running the Application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Front-End Solution

We employed TypeScript for robust type safety, ensuring stable and error-free code throughout development. JavaScript along with Tailwind CSS powered our application with dynamic functionality, complemented by Next.js for efficient server-side rendering and seamless page routing.

### Screens

- **Initial Screen:** Introduces users to the application, allowing them to enter the prompt.
- **Loading Screen:** Manages loading the "generated" image using the machine learning model based on the prompt.
- **Final Screen:** Displays the details about the generated product along with available sizes, description, and styling ideas, along with an AR option to virtually try on the clothing.

## Back-End Solution

### Integration of Next.js and Express.js

- **Efficient Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Utilizing Next.js for SSR capabilities, enhancing performance and SEO by generating pages on the server.
- **Express.js Middleware:** Integrating Express.js middleware for handling API requests and enhancing server functionality.

### Routing and API Handling

- **Next.js Routing:** Leveraging Next.js routing for seamless navigation between frontend pages and API routes.
- **RESTful API Development:** Using Express.js to develop RESTful APIs, enabling efficient communication between frontend and backend.
